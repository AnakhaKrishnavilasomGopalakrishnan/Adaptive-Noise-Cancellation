# Adaptive-Noise-Cancellation
The purpose of this project is to learn how to implement and use an adaptive filter algorithm: the least mean squares algorithm (LMS). Your task is to implement and study properties of the LMS algorithm on the same platform that we used for Project 1A (i.e. the DSP-kit). The particular application which we are targeting here is noise cancellation
